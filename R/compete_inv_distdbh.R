#' Calculate Tree Competition Indices Using Distance and DBH Inventory Data
#'
#' @description
#' 'compete_dd()' returns a specific distance-DBH-dependent competition index
#' (or group of indices) for a list of target trees within a forest plot
#'
#' @param plot_path character path to inventory table (.csv or .txt) of the
#'   plot, with structure: ID, X, Y, DBH (in m). Coordinates have to be in
#'   metric system (in m)!
#' @param ttrees_path character path to table/list (.csv or .txt) of target
#'   trees within plot with ID_target, X, Y (does not have to be the same ID as
#'   in inventory table). Coordinates have to be in metric system!
#' @param radius numeric, Search radius (in m) around target tree, wherein all
#' neighboring trees are classified as competitors
#' @param method character string assigning the method for quantifying
#' competition "CI_Hegyi", "CI_RK1", "CI_RK2" or "all"
#' @param tolerance numeric. Tolerance for the match with the tree coordinates.
#' If a field measurement value is used for target_tree, take a higher tolerance
#' value (default=1 m), depending on the measurement accuracy
#' @param dbh_thr numeric, DBH threshold for classifying the tree as a
#'  competitor (default is 0.1 m; trees with DBH smaller 0.1 m are no
#'  competitors)
#' @param dbh_max numeric, DBH threshold (max) in m, that is realistic for the
#' trees. (default: 1 m). It causes a warning message, if one or more tree
#' within your plot shows higher DBH values.
#'
#' @details
#' Using an inventory table to easily quantify distance-dependent tree
#' competition for a single tree within a plot.
#' The input data can either be taken directly from field measurements or
#' derived beforehand from LiDAR point clouds.
#' It is possible to choose between certain Competition indices, as e.g.
#' the Hegyi index (method = "Hegyi") according to Hegyi (1974).
#'
#' @section Methods:
#'  * CI_Hegyi Index introduced by Hegyi (1974)
#'    \eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i} / (d \cdot dist_{i})}
#'  * CI_RK1 according to Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
#'    \eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathrm{arctan}(d_{i} / dist_{i})}
#'  * CI_RK2 according to Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
#'    \eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_{i} / d) \cdot \mathrm{arctan}(d_{i} / dist_{i})}
