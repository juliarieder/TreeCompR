#' @title Position and Height of a Tree from Point Cloud
#'
#' @description Compute the stem base position, metroid of the crown projected
#'   area and the stem height of a tree
#'
#' @param tree tree_pc or data.frame (x, y, z) of the tree point cloud.
#'   Coordinates have to be in metric system!
#' @param z_min integer of length 1 describing the the minimum number of points
#'   needed in the lowermost 1 voxel depth Z layer to consider it part of the
#'   tree. Default is 100. If changing the voxel resolution (res) from the
#'   default value of 0.1, different settings may be necessary.
#' @param h_xy numeric of length 1 describing the height range in m over the
#'   stem base over which the x and y positions are used to calculate the x and
#'   y coordinates of the stem base. Default is 0.3 m.
#' @param res res numeric of length 1 defining the resolution of a voxel as
#'   passed on to [VoxR::vox()]. Defaults to 0.1 (10 cm voxel size).
#' @param tree_name character vector of length 1 with the name of the tree as
#'   returned with the output object. Defaults to NULL (take name from `tree`
#'   argument).
#'
#' @details Calculates the stem base position, metroid of the crown projected
#'   area and height of a tree from a data.frame with  a point cloud as created
#'   with [read_pc()].
#'
#'   For the *stem base*, the z position is taken as the z position of the first
#'   voxel layer containing at least z_min points of the point cloud (the
#'   standard value is 100). This is done to avoid outlying values affecting the
#'   calculated stem base height and should usually be consistent with taking
#'   the median z value of the lowermost group of points, but with a lower
#'   sensitivity to outliers.
#'   The x and y position of the stem base are calculated as the median of the
#'   voxelized x and y coordinates of all voxels in the first h_xy m over the
#'   stem base (on default: first 0.3 m - values that are too low should be
#'   avoided here as the stem shape may be irregular close to the ground).
#'
#'   The *central point of the crown projected area* is computed as the median
#'   of the x and y position of the projected area of the tree.
#'
#'   The *height* is based on difference between the z value of the highest
#'   voxel belonging to the tree over and the z value identified for the stem
#'   base.
#'
#'   The calculation is done on voxels to ensure consistency with downstream
#'   analyses and to reduce bias caused by inhomogeneous point densities on
#'   different sides of the stem.
#'
#'   In our opinion, in most cases it makes more sense to calculate competition
#'   indices based on the central point of the tree crown than based on the
#'   stem base because for strongly inclined trees a cylinder constructed around
#'   its base may contain no voxels of the crown of the central tree at all.
