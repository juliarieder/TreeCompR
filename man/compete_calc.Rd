\title{Calculate Tree Competition Indices From Inventory Data}
\usage{
compete_calc(
  path,
  radius = 10,
  dbh_thr = 0.1,
  target_tree,
  type = c("ID", "coordinates"),
  tolerance = 0.1,
  method = c("all", "Hegyi", "CI11", "CI12", "CI13")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{character string path to .csv file with inventory data with structure (ID, X, Y, DBH, H), DBH and H in m. Each row indicates one tree within the plot}

\item{radius}{numeric, Search radius (in m) around target tree, wherein all neighboring trees are classified as competitors}

\item{dbh_thr}{numeric, DBH threshold for classifying the tree as a competitor (default is 0.1 m)}

\item{target_tree}{numeric (ID) or a vector of coordinates c(X, Y)}

\item{type}{character string specifying the type of input of target_tree "ID" or "coordinates".}

\item{tolerance}{numeric. Tolerance for the match with the tree coordinates. If a field measurement value is used for target_tree, take a higher tolerance value (default=0.1 m), depending on the measurement accuracy}

\item{method}{character string assigning the method for quantifying competition "Hegyi", "CI11", "CI12", "CI13" or "all"}
}
\value{
numeric. Competition Index value
}
\description{
'compete_calc()' returns a specific distance-dependent competition index (or group of indexes) for a target tree within a forest plot

Using an inventory table to easily quantify distance-dependant tree competition for a single tree within a plot.
The input data can either be taken directly from field measurements or derived beforehand from LiDAR point clouds.
It is possible to choose between certain Competition indices, like the Hegyi index (method = "Hegyi") according to Hegyi (1974). .....

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calculate some distance-dependent CIs for one tree inside forest plot
# input coordinates target tree
ttree <- c(15, 9)
CI <- compete_calc("path/to/invtable.csv", dbh_thr = 0.1, ttree, "coordinates", 0.1, method = "all")

# Calculate the Hegyi-Index for one tree inside a forest plot, giving the ID of the target tree
ID_tree <- 5
CI <- compete_calc("path/to/invtable.csv", dbh_thr = 0.1, ID_tree, "ID", 0.1, method = "Hegyi")
#}
