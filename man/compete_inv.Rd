\title{Calculate Tree Competition Indices From Inventory Data}
\usage{
compete_inv(
  seg_path,
  tree_path,
  radius,
  method = c("all", "Hegyi", "CI10", "CI11", "CI12", "CI13")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg_path}{character path to inventory table (.csv or .txt) with structure: ID, X, Y, H}

\item{tree_path}{character path to table/list (.csv or .txt) of target trees within plot with ID_target, X, Y (does not have to be the same ID as in inventory table)}

\item{radius}{numeric, Search radius (in m) around target tree, wherein all neighboring trees are classified as competitors}

\item{method}{character string assigning the method for quantifying competition "Hegyi", "CI11", "CI12", "CI13" or "all"}
}
\value{
dataframe with ID_target, and one or more indices per tree, which depends on the chosen method
}
\description{
'compete_inv()' returns a specific distance-dependent competition index (or group of indexes) for a list of target trees within a forest plot
}
\section{Methods}{

\itemize{
\item Hegyi Index introduced by Hegyi (1974)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i} / (d * dist_{i})}
\item CI10 according to Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} arctan(d_{i} / dist_{i})}
\item CI11 according to Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_{i} / d) * arctan(d_{i} / dist_{i})}
\item CI12 according to Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} arctan(h_{i} / dist_{i})}
\item CI13 according to Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (h_{i} / h) * arctan(h_{i} / dist_{i})}
}
