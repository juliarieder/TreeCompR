\title{Calculate Tree Competition Indices Using Distance and DBH Inventory Data}
\usage{
compete_dd(
  plot_source,
  target_source,
  radius,
  method = c("all", "CI_Hegyi", "CI_RK1", "CI_RK2"),
  tolerance = 1,
  dbh_unit = c("m", "cm", "mm"),
  dbh_thr = 10,
  dbh_max = 100,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot_source}{dataframe or path to inventory table of the
plot, with structure: ID, x, y, dbh (in m, cm or mm; specify in dbh_unit!).
Cartesian coordinates have to be in metric system (in m)!}

\item{target_source}{dataframe or path to table of target trees within plot
with ID_target, x, y (does not have to be the same ID as in inventory table).
Cartesian coordinates have to be in metric system!}

\item{radius}{numeric, Search radius (in m) around target tree, wherein all
neighboring trees are classified as competitors}

\item{method}{character string assigning the method for quantifying
competition "CI_Hegyi", "CI_RK1", "CI_RK2" or "all"}

\item{tolerance}{numeric. Tolerance for the match with the tree coordinates.
If a field measurement value is used for target_tree, take a higher tolerance
value (default=1 m), depending on the GPS accuracy}

\item{dbh_unit}{character string for used unit of dbh in inventory data
"m", "cm" or "mm"}

\item{dbh_thr}{numeric, dbh threshold for classifying the tree as a
competitor (default is 10 cm; trees with dbh smaller 10 cm are no
competitors)}

\item{dbh_max}{numeric, dbh threshold (max) in cm, that is realistic for the
trees. (default: 100 cm). It causes a warning message, if one or more tree
within your plot shows higher dbh values.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed on to \code{\link[data.table:fread]{data.table::fread()}}}
}
\value{
dataframe with ID_target, and one or more indices per tree,
depending on chosen method
}
\description{
'compete_dd()' returns a specific distance-DBH-dependent competition index
(or group of indices) for a list of target trees within a forest plot
}
\details{
Using an inventory table to easily quantify distance-dependent tree
competition for a single tree within a plot.
The input data can either be taken directly from field measurements or
derived beforehand from LiDAR point clouds.
It is possible to choose between certain Competition indices, as e.g.
the Hegyi index (method = "Hegyi") according to Hegyi (1974).

\section{Methods}{

\itemize{
\item CI_Hegyi Index introduced by Hegyi (1974)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i} / (d \cdot dist_{i})}
\item CI_RK1 according to CI1 Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathrm{arctan}(d_{i} / dist_{i})}
\item CI_RK2 according to CI3 in Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_{i} / d) \cdot \mathrm{arctan}(d_{i} / dist_{i})}
}
