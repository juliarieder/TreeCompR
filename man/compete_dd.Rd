\title{Calculate Tree Competition Indices From Inventory Data (distance-DBH-dependent)}
\usage{
compete_dd(
  plot_path,
  ttrees_path,
  radius,
  method = c("all", "CI_Hegyi", "CI_RK1", "CI_RK2"),
  dbh_thr = 0.1,
  tolerance = 1,
  dbh_max = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot_path}{character path to inventory table (.csv or .txt) of the plot, with structure: ID, X, Y, DBH (in m). Coordinates have to be in metric system (in m)!}

\item{ttrees_path}{character path to table/list (.csv or .txt) of target trees within plot with ID_target, X, Y (does not have to be the same ID as in inventory table). Coordinates have to be in metric system!}

\item{radius}{numeric, Search radius (in m) around target tree, wherein all neighboring trees are classified as competitors}

\item{method}{character string assigning the method for quantifying competition "CI_Hegyi", "CI_RK1", "CI_RK2" or "all"}

\item{dbh_thr}{numeric, DBH threshold for classifying the tree as a competitor (default is 0.1 m; trees with DBH smaller 0.1 m are no competitors)}

\item{tolerance}{numeric. Tolerance for the match with the tree coordinates. If a field measurement value is used for target_tree, take a higher tolerance value (default=1 m), depending on the measurement accuracy}

\item{dbh_max}{numeric, DBH threshold (max) in m, that is realistic for the trees. (default: 1 m). It causes a warning message, if one or more tree within your plot shows higher DBH values.}
}
\value{
dataframe with ID_target, and one or more indices per tree, depending on chosen method
}
\description{
'compete_dd()' returns a specific distance-DBH-dependent competition index (or group of indices) for a list of target trees within a forest plot
}
\details{
Using an inventory table to easily quantify distance-dependant tree competition for a single tree within a plot.
The input data can either be taken directly from field measurements or derived beforehand from LiDAR point clouds.
It is possible to choose between certain Competition indices, as e.g. the Hegyi index (method = "Hegyi") according to Hegyi (1974).

\section{Methods}{

\itemize{
\item CI_Hegyi Index introduced by Hegyi (1974)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i} / (d * dist_{i})}
\item CI_RK1 according to Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} arctan(d_{i} / dist_{i})}
\item CI_RK2 according to Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997)
\eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_{i} / d) * arctan(d_{i} / dist_{i})}
}
