\title{QUantify Competition using inventory data from ALS}
\usage{
compete_ALS(seg_path, tree_path, radius)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg_path}{character path to inventory table (.csv or .txt) with structure: ID, X, Y, H}

\item{tree_path}{character path to table/list (.csv or .txt) of target trees within plot with ID_target, X, Y (does not have to be the same ID as in inventory table)}

\item{radius}{numeric, Search radius (in m) around target tree, wherein all neighboring trees are classified as competitors}
}
\value{
dataframe with ID_target, CI12, CI13
}
\description{
'Compete_ALS()' returns a specific distance-dependent competition index (or group of indexes) for a target tree within a forest plot
}
\details{
Using an inventory table to easily quantify distance-dependant tree competition for row of trees within a plot.
The input data can either be taken directly from field measurements or derived beforehand from LiDAR point clouds.
It calculates two Competition indices, based on tree heights and distance to competitors.
