## Overview 

With `TreeCompR`, it is possible to easily compute size-distance-dependent competition indices based on inventory data. This data can be collected in the field, or derived or modeled from 3D point clouds. Depending on the input data, there are some necessary pre-processing steps. We prepared two tutorials for processing laser scanning data to obtain appropriate inventory data:

* From airborne laser scanning data to competition indices: vignette("ALS_inventory"): [ALS workflow](https://juliarieder.github.io/TreeCompR/articles/ALS_inventory.html) 
* From ground-based laser scanning data (from MLS/TLS) to competition indices: [TLS workflow](https://juliarieder.github.io/TreeCompR/articles/TLS_inventory.html) 


## Analyzing inventory data with TreeCompR
To illustrate how `TreeCompR` can be included inside a tidy workflow, we will make use of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) functions throughout the tutorial:

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
library(TreeCompR)
library(tidyverse)
```

To highlight where they are coming from, we will explicitly quote the corresponding package for all functions used in the tutorial in the form of `purrr::map()` for all functions besides the `magrittr` pipe operator `%>%`.

### Reading in forest inventory data with with `read_inv()`
To be able to be parsed as a `forest_inv` object, inventory data must contain x and y coordinates of the individual trees, and to be able to compute competition they must to contain at least one size-related variable (e.g. height or diameter at breast height, or others when working with custom indices). 

To ensure that the inventory data is assigned correctly, inspect the data thoroughly. Make sure to specify the units for dbh and height if they differ from the default, which is cm for dbh and m for height. Tree coordinates should __always__ be specified in m. You can either use `read_inv()` to validate data.frames or paths to files with inventory data and convert them to an object type used by the `TreeCompR` functions, or directly pass them to `compete_inv()`. The former is especially useful if you have data with non-standard column names or data structures and want to have full control over how they are parsed.

In a simple case, reading data with `read_inv()` with standard settings (except for the metric tree diameters) looks like this:

```{r read-inv1, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# read inventory with diameter units set to m
inventory1 <- read_inv(
  inv_source = "data/inventory1.csv",
  dbh_unit = "m")
#> The following columns were used to create the inventory dataset:
#> id     ---	ID
#> x      ---	X
#> y      ---	Y
#> dbh    ---	DBH
```

If `verbose = TRUE` (the default), `read_inv()` prints the names of the main inventory variables from the original data set. This is helpful as a sanity check for the automatic column detection. 

`read_inv()` does flexibly recognize a large number of different spellings for the common inventory variables. If provided with tabular data without explicitly specified variable names, the function by default takes the columns named "X" and "Y" (or "x" and "y") to be the tree coordinates, and looks for columns named "height", "height_m" or "h" as well as "dbh", "diameter","diam", or "d" (in any capitalization) as size-related variables. The tree ids are taken from columns named "id", "tree_id", "treeID" or "tree.id" (in any capitalization). All special characters besides "." and "_" are stripped from the column names before matching. If `verbose = TRUE`, the function will inform you which columns were automatically identified to avoid errors.

The resulting object looks like this (basically a data.table object that is printed with a header to easily identify it as a "forest_inv" object). 
``` {r read-inv1a, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inventory1
#> ---------------------------------------  
#> 'forest_inv' class inventory dataset: 
#> collection of 63 observations 
#> ---------------------------------------
#>         id      x      y    dbh
#>     <char>  <num>  <num>  <num>
#>  1:  22461  1.009  0.908  5.047
#>  2:  22462 11.683  1.449  6.786
#>  3:  22541  6.770  2.155  4.675
#> ---                            
#> 61:  24508  9.390 28.357 40.283
#> 62:  24545  5.350 27.977 32.405
#> 63:  24611 16.750 28.615 43.841
```


If you have variable names that cannot be automatically recognized, you can specify them explicitly with the corresponding arguments either as a character string of length 1 with the variable name or by directly specifying the name without quotes. 
For example, assume you have a data set with (metric) UTM coordinates from a Spanish source, i.e. with "dap_cm" (diámetro en altura de pecho) instead of dbh and "altura" instead of height:

```{r read-inv2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# read inventory with custom (Spanish) column titles
inventory2 <- read_inv(
  inv_source = "data/inventory2.csv",  
  x = utmx,
  y = utmy,
  dbh = dap_cm,
  height = altura,
  dbh_unit = "cm", 
  height_unit = "m")
#> The following columns were used to create the inventory dataset:
#> id     ---	automatically generated
#> x      ---	utmx
#> y      ---	utmy
#> dbh    ---	dap_cm
#> height ---	altura
```

Note that in this case, the function automatically generated an "id" column with ascending numbers as there was nothing in the raw data that could be automatically identified as an ID:

```{r read-inv2a, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
inventory2
#> ---------------------------------------  
#> 'forest_inv' class inventory dataset: 
#> collection of 88 observations 
#> ---------------------------------------
#>         id      x      y    dbh height
#>     <char>  <num>  <num>  <num>  <num>
#>  1:      1  0.573  0.168  7.232 13.168
#>  2:      2 19.330  0.844  8.064 11.565
#>  3:      3 10.182  0.383 10.779 13.615
#> ---                                   
#> 86:     86 12.829 29.278  3.713  7.780
#> 87:     87 26.712 29.375  1.641  4.306
#> 88:     88  6.962 29.644  4.585 10.219
```

Non-standard field separators etc. can be internally passed on to `data.table::fread()` via the `...` arguments to read more exotic formats such as the semicolon-separated ".csv" files with commas as decimal separators used for example in Germany. If the units are not specified explicitly, it is assumed that they are in the standard units (m for height and cm for diameter) and do not need conversion.

```{r read-inv3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# read inventory with custom decimal and column separators
inventory3 <- read_inv(
  inv_source = "data/inventory3.csv", 
  dec = ",",
  sep = ";", 
  verbose = FALSE)
```

In many cases, pre-processing of the inventories based on other variables than coordinates and tree size is necessary. For that reason, it is possible to read in any objects that inherit from class `data.frame` (e.g., tibbles, data.tables or actual data.frames) with `read_inv()`. In this example, a dataset is first read in externally and filtered to get data of only one of the plots in the dataset and then read in.

```{r read-inv4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# read dataset outside read_inv and filter to a single plot
dat <- readr::read_csv("data/inventory4.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::filter(plot_id == "Plot 1")

inventory4 <- read_inv(
  inv_source = dat,
  dbh = diam,
  dbh_unit = "cm", 
  height_unit = "m", 
  verbose = FALSE)

```

If there are additional columns that should be kept in the forest inventory dataset (such as the canopy area in this case), it is possible to specify `keep_rest = TRUE`:

```{r read-inv4a, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# read same inventory without dropping columns
inventory4a <- read_inv(
  inv_source = dat,
  dbh = diam,
  dbh_unit = "cm", 
  height_unit = "m", 
  keep_rest = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE)
inventory4a

### Designating target trees with `define_target()`
To select target trees for computing competition indices, you can use the function `define_target()`. 

There are many different ways of specifying target trees that are described in the documentation of `define_target()`. Briefly, you can directly supply tree IDs as a character string, you can define them based on logical vectors, you can supply another `forest_inv` object created with `read_tree()` that contains their coordinates, or finally with a character string specifying a method to define the target trees ("buff_edge", "exclude_edge" and "all_trees"). 


Defining targets with a vector of tree IDs could look like this, assuming you want to compute competition indices for 3 adjacent _Fagus sylvatica_ trees and this is your naming scheme:

```{r define-target1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# set target trees based on vector with tree ids
targets1 <- define_target(
  inv = inventory1, 
  target_source = c("FASY-43-27", "FASY-43-28", "FASY-43-29")
  )
```

You might also want to define target trees based on a logical criterion, for instance for all trees whose ID contains "FASY":

```{r define-target2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# set target trees based on logical vector
targets2 <- define_target(
  inv = inventory1, 
  target_source = grepl("FASY", inventory1$id)
  )
```

In many cases you will have target tree coordinates that come from a different data source and have a different accuracy than the inventory data, for instance when you perform a ground-based study focusing on single trees and wish to derive tree competition from ALS sources based on the GPS coordinates from your trees. In these cases, you will have to match the GPS coordinates against the tree coordinates derived from the ALS source (see [ALS workflow](https://juliarieder.github.io/TreeCompR/articles/ALS_inventory.html) for details on how to derive inventory data from ALS sources).

In these cases, it is possible to supply an inventory based on a second set of coordinates as a `target_source` which is then matched against the inventory data. IDs are then ignored (as they are likely automatically generated anyway) and matching is based only on the closest trees with in a buffer of `tol` m (the default is `tol = 1`: matching within 1 m). All further size-related variables in the second set of coordinates are ignored as well to ensure the competition indices are based on the same data source:

```{r define-target3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# read target tree positions
target_pos <- read_inv("data/target_tree_gps.csv", x = gps_x, y = gps_y)
# define target trees
targets3 <- define_target(
  inv = inventory1, 
  target_source = target_pos,
  tol = 1 # match within 1 m accuracy
  )
```

If no trees in the inventory are in the desired distance of one or more of your target trees, you will receive a warning, while if there is more than one equally good match for a target tree, the function will fail with an error.

In many cases, there will be no list of a priori specified target trees, and the aim will be to calculate valid competition indices for as many trees as possible. In these cases, we recommend to use `target_source = "buff_edge"`. This automatically designates all trees in the plot that are at least one search radius away from the plot edge (roughly approximated by a concave hull) to avoid edge effects. This is specifically important for TLS/MLS data and classical forest inventories, since in contrast to ALS-derived datasets these data usually cover relatively small forest plot rather than entire forests. Setting `target_source = "exclude_edge"` only removes the trees on the edge of the plot without checking how close the rest of the trees is from the edge and is hence less restrictive but more prone to edge effects than the previous option. If you use these spatially explicit methods of defining target trees, make sure that your inventory only contains data from one plot as currently grouping is not possible in `define_target()`. If you want to consider doing this for a larger number of plots, consider e.g. mapping over the plots with [purrr::map()] to compute the output step by step. 

Here is an example of how to identify all potential target trees that run in no risk of excluding potential edge trees when computing competition indices with a search radius of 10 m:

```{r define-target4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
targets4 <- define_target(
  inv = inventory1, 
  target_source = "buff_edge", 
  radius = 10)
targets4
#> --------------------------------------------------------------- 
#> 'target_inv' class inventory dataset with defined target trees: 
#> collection of 48 observations 
#> Source of target trees: buffer around edge 
#> ---------------------------------------------------------------
#>     id      x      y    dbh target
#> 1    1 15.181 -2.979 35.275  FALSE
#> 2    2 13.097  0.193 20.068  FALSE
#> 3    3 12.633 -9.445 35.333  FALSE
#>    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...
#> 46  51 -1.639 -4.842 12.605  FALSE
#> 47  52 -6.409 -4.722  6.035  FALSE
#> 48  53 -7.485 -7.619 20.065  FALSE
```

While it is possible to compute competition indices for all trees (`target_source = "all_trees"`), this results in a warning and should only be done if there __very good reasons__ to assume that the edge trees in the data are actually situated at the forest edge, as otherwise there will be _intense_ edge effects: for a tree on a straight plot edge, on average nearly half and for a tree in an edge position in a rectangular plot  3/4 of the competitors will be missing in the data!


### Inspecting the target selection with `plot_target()`

To visually inspect the position of the designated target trees relative to the other trees in the neighbourhood, you can use the function `plot_target()`, which automatically displays the relevant information depending on the `target_source` setting for both `target_inv` datasets and the output of `compete_inv()` itself:

```{r plot-target, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot_target(targets4)
```
<img src="../man/figures/README-example3-1.png" alt="plot_trees" width="500">

The purpose of this function is to provide a fast tool for visual inspection rather than to create beautiful visual output. As all the data for the plot are contained in the `target_inv` object, more appealing (e.g., [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)-based) visualizations are left as an exercise to the user. 

### Computing competition indices with `compete_inv()`
`compete_inv()` is very flexible with its input, in essence directly accepting everything that can also be loaded with `read_inv()` and also passing additional settings for column specifications etc. on to this function, which is used to load the data internally. Also all options for `target_source` that can be set in `define_target()` can be directly specified in `compete_inv()`, and in most cases this function will likely be called directly unless there are reasons to perform the other steps explicitly, for instance, because the data structure and formatting differ between the inventory and target files or because an inspection of the target settings is desired _before_ computing the results.

If target trees have already been specified with `target_inv()`, the outcome can directly be passed to `compete_inv()`, which then ignores the target_source argument and all further arguments that are passed on to `read_inv()` and `define_target()`.

```{r comp1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
compete_inv(inv_source = targets4, radius = 10, method = "CI_Hegyi")
#> --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#> 'compete_inv' class inventory with distance-based competition indices 
#> Collection of data for 1 target and 47 edge trees. 
#> Source of target trees: buffer around edge    Search radius: 10 
#> ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#>    id     x      y  dbh CI_Hegyi
#> 44 48 0.102 -0.494 24.4     4.39
```

Otherwise, it is for example possible to calculate the Hegyi competition index from a data from a .csv source with non-standard column names and decimal and field separators (in this example, from a German file source) and then get reasonable target trees via `target_source = "buff_edge"`:

```{r comp2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
CI1 <- compete_inv(
  inv_source = "data/inventory5.csv",
  target_source = "buff_edge",
  radius = 10, 
  method = "CI_Hegyi",
  x = Koord_x, 
  y = Koord_y,
  id = Baumname,
  dbh = Durchmesser,
  sep = ";",
  dec = ","
  )
```

The output of this function can then again be inspected in the same way as above using `plot_target(CI1)` to make sure the selection of target trees make sense.

#### Available competition indices
The function computes a series of inventory-based competition indices commonly used in the literature that can be specified via the `method` argument ([Hegyi 1974](https://search.worldcat.org/title/growth-models-for-tree-and-stand-simulation-proceedings-of-meetings-in-1973/oclc/1273734); Braathe, 1980; [Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1139/x97-012); see also [Contreras et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.08.031)). These are either based on tree diameter at breast height ("CI_Hegyi", "CI_RK1", "CI_RK2") or on tree height ("CI_Braathe", "CI_RK3", "CI_RK4"). 

The competition indices are computed according to the following equations, where $d_i$ and $h_i$ are the dbh and height of neighbor tree $i$, $d$ and $h$ are dbh and height of the target tree, and $dist_i$ is the distance from neighbor tree $i$ to the target tree.

**Diameter-based competition indices**

**CI_Hegyi** introduced by Hegyi (1974): 
$$CI_{Hegyi} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i} / (d \cdot dist_{i})$$
**CI_RK1** according to CI1 Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997): 
$$CI_{RK1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathrm{arctan}(d_{i} / dist_{i})$$
**CI_RK2** according to CI3 in Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997): 
$$CI_{RK2} =\sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_{i} / d) \cdot \mathrm{arctan}(d_{i} / dist_{i})$$

**Height-based competition indices**

**CI_Braathe** according to Braathe (1980): 
$$CI_{Braathe} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} h_{i} / (h \cdot dist_{i})$$
**CI_RK3** according to CI5 in Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997): 
$$CI_{RK3} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathrm{arctan}(h_{i} / dist_{i})$$ 
for all trees with $h_{i} > h$

**CI_RK4** based on CI3 in Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen (1997) and Contreras et al. (2011):
$$CI_{RK4} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (h_{i} / h) \cdot    \mathrm{arctan}(h_{i} / dist_{i})$$

An advantage of the classical distance-based indices (CI_Hegyi and CI_Braathe) is their clear interpretation as the sum of the relative sizes of the neighbour trees relative to the target tree size, weighted by their distance to the target tree. 


If `method = "all_methods"` (the standard setting), `compete_inv()` computes all indices that can be computed with the data available in the inventory. 

```{r comp3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
compete_inv(inv_source = targets4, radius = 10, method = "all_methods")
#> --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#> 'compete_inv' class inventory with distance-based competition indices 
#> Collection of data for 1 target and 47 edge trees. 
#> Source of target trees: buffer around edge    Search radius: 10 
#> ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#>    id     x      y  dbh CI_Hegyi CI_RK1 CI_RK2
#> 44 48 0.102 -0.494 24.4     4.39     33   38.5
```


## Choosing a search radius
All indices that can be calculated with `compete_inv()` are based on a distance-weighted sum of the relative size of all neighbor trees within the search radius compared to the size of the central tree, or a sum of a transformation thereof. As the search radius determines how many trees are included for calculating these metric for each tree, all these distance-based competition indices are extremely sensitive to the choice of the search radius. An obvious consequence of this is that it is not meaningfully possible to compare distance based competition indices calculated with different search radii. Perhaps less obvious is that as different tree species differ in their average size and rooting patterns, the optimal search radius may differ between species, and that comparisons between species using competition indices computed with the same settings may not always result in meaningful results. 
Some authors recommend to use a search radius based on the average crown size of the trees in the plot, such as [Lorimer (1983)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-1127(83)90042-7), who propose a search radius of 3.5 average crown radii. While such a recommendation certainly makes more sense than sticking to standard values like 10 m independent of whether calculating competition for stunted Elfin forests or gigantic Redwood trees, ultimately such a setting will always be arbitrary and that there are limits to the comparability of the indices across studies and across species.
