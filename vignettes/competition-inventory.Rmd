## Overview 

Within `TreeCompR` it is possible to easily derive size-distance-dependent competition indices based on inventory data. This data can be collected in the field, or derived or modelled from 3D point clouds. Depending on the input data, there are some necessary pre-processing steps. Check out our workflows: <!-- Yo, Digga -->

## Analyzing inventory data with TreeCompR
To illustrate how TreeCompR can be included inside a tidy workflow, we will make use of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) function throughout the tutorial:

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
library(TreeCompR)
library(tidyverse)
```

However, we will explicitly quote the corresponding package for all functions used in the tutorial in the form of `purrr::map()` for all functions besides the `magrittr` pipe operator `%>%`.

### Reading in forest inventory data with with `read_inv()`
The inventory data must contain x and y coordinates of the individual trees, and to be able to compute competition have to contain at least one more size-related variable (e.g. height or diameter at breast height). 

To ensure that the inventory data is assigned correctly, inspect the data thoroughly. Make sure to specify the units for dbh and height if they differ from the default, which is cm for dbh and m for height. Tree coordinates should __always__ be specified in m. You can either use `read_inv()` to validate your inventory data and convert them to an object type used by the `TreeCompR` functions, or directly pass data.frames or paths to files to `compete_inv()`. The former is especially useful if you have data with non-standard column names or data structures and want to fully control how they are parsed.


In a simple case, reading data with `read_inv()` with standard settings (except for the metric tree diameters) looks like this:

```{r read-inv1, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inventory1 <- read_inv(
  inv_source = "data/inventory1.csv", 
  dbh_unit = "m", 
  height_unit = "m")
```

`read_inv()` does flexibly recognize a large number of different spellings for the common inventory variables. If provided with tabular data without explicitly specified variable names, the function by default takes the columns named "X" and "Y" (or "x" and "y") to be the tree coordinates, and looks for columns named "height", "height_m" or "h" as well as "dbh", "diameter","diam", or "d" (in any capitalization) as size-related variables. The tree ids are taken from columns named "id", "tree_id", "treeID" or "tree.id" (in any capitalization). All special characters besides "." and "_" are stripped from the column names before matching. If `verbose = TRUE`, the function will inform you which columns were automatically identifided to avoid errors.

If you have variable names that cannot be automatically recognized, you can specify them explicitly with the corresponding arguments either as a character string of length 1 with the variable name or by directly specifying the name without quotes. 
For example, assume you have a data set with (metric) UTM coordinates from a Spanish source, i.e. with "dap_cm" (diÃ¡metro en altura de pecho) instead of dbh and "altura" instead of height:

```{r read-inv2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
inventory2 <- read_inv(
  inv_source = "data/inventory2.csv",  
  x = utmx,
  y = utmy,
  dbh = dap_cm,
  height = altura,
  dbh_unit = "cm", 
  height_unit = "m")
```

Non-standard field separators etc. can be internally passed on to `data.table::fread()` via the `...` arguments to read more exotic formats such as the semicolon-separated ".csv" files with commas as decimal separators used for example in Germany. 

```{r read-inv3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
inventory1 <- read_inv(
  inv_source = "data/inventory3.csv", 
  dbh_unit = "m", 
  height_unit = "m", 
  dec = ",",
  sep = ";")
```

In many cases, pre-processing of the inventories based on other variables than coordinates and tree size is necessary. For that reason, it is possible to read in any objects that inherit from class `data.frame` (e.g., tibbles, data.tables or actual data.frames) with `read_inv()`:

```{r read-inv4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# read dataset outside read_inv and filter to the plot in question
dat <- readr::read_csv("data/inventory4.csv") %>% 
  filter(plot_id == "Plot 1")
  
# use read_inv to convert to a forest_inv object that works with TreeCompR functions
inventory4 <- read_inv(
  inv_source = dat,
  dbh = DAP,
  dbh_unit = "cm", 
  height_unit = "m")
```

### Designating target trees with `define_target()`
To select target trees for computing competition indices, you can use the function `define_target()`. 

There are many different ways of specifying target trees that are described in the documentation of `define_target()`. Briefly, you can directly supply tree IDs as a character string, you can define them based on logical vectors, you can supply another `forest_inv` object created with `read_tree()` that contains their coordinates, or finally with a character string specifying a method to define the target trees ("buff_edge", "exclude_edge" and "all_trees"). 


Defining targets with a vector of tree IDs could look like this, assuming you want to compute competition indices for 3 adjacent _Fagus sylvatica_ trees and this is your naming scheme:

```{r define-target1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# set target trees based on vector with tree ids
targets1 <- define_target(
  inv = inventory1, 
  target_source = c("FASY-43-27", "FASY-43-28", "FASY-43-29")
  )
```

You might also want to define target trees based on a logical criterion, for instance for all trees whose ID contains "FASY":

```{r define-target2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# set target trees based on logical vector
targets2 <- define_target(
  inv = inventory1, 
  target_source = grepl("FASY", inventory1$id)
  )
```

In many cases you will have target tree coordinates that come from a different data source and have a different accuracy than the inventory data, for instance when you perform a ground-based study focusing on single trees and wish to derive tree competition from ALS sources based on the GPS coordinates from your trees. In these cases, you will have to match the GPS coordinates against the tree coordinates derived from the ALS source (see [ALS workflow](https://juliarieder.github.io/TreeCompR/articles/ALS_inventory.html) for details on how to derive inventory data from ALS sources).

In these cases, it is possible to supply an inventory based on a second set of coordinates as a `target_source` which is then matched against the inventory data. IDs are then ignored (as they are likely automatically generated anyway) and matching is based only on the closest trees with in a buffer of `tol` m (the default is `tol = 1`: matching within 1 m). All further size-related variables in the second set of coordinates are ignored as well to ensure the competition indices are based on the same data source:

```{r define-target3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# read target tree positions
target_pos <- read_inv("data/target_tree_gps.csv", x = gps_x, y = gps_y)
# define target trees
targets3 <- define_target(
  inv = inventory1, 
  target_source = target_pos,
  tol = 1 # match within 1 m accuracy
  )
```

If no trees in the inventory are in the desired distance of one or more of your target trees, you will receive a warning, while if there is more than one equally good match for a target tree, the function will fail with an error.

In many cases, there will be no list of a priori specified target trees, and the aim will be to calculate valid competition indices for as many trees as possible. In these cases, we recommend to use `target_source = "buff_edge"`. This automatically designates all trees in the plot that are at least one search radius away from the plot edge (roughly approximated by a concave hull) to avoid edge effects. This is specifically important for TLS/MLS data and classical forest inventories, since in contrast to ALS-derived datasets these data usually cover relatively small forest plot rather than entire forests. Setting `target_source = "exclude_edge"` only removes the trees on the edge of the plot without checking how close the rest of the trees is from the edge and is hence less restrictive but more prone to edge effects than the previous option. If you use these spatially explicit methods of defining target trees, make sure that your inventory only contains data from one plot as currently grouping is not possible in `define_target()`. If you want to consider doing this for a larger number of plots, consider e.g. mapping over the plots with [purrr::map()] to compute the output step by step. 

Here is an example of how to identify all potential target trees that run in no risk of excluding potential edge trees when computing competition indices with a search radius of 10 m:

```{r define-target4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
targets4 <- define_target(
  inv = inventory1, 
  target_source = "buff_edge", 
  radius = 10)
```

While it is possible to compute competition indices for all trees (`target_source = "all_trees"`), this results in a warning and should only be done if there __very good reasons__ to assume that the edge trees in the data are actually situated at the forest edge, as otherwise there will be _intense_ edge effects: for a tree on a straight plot edge, on average nearly half and for a tree in an edge position in a rectangular plot  3/4 of the competitors will be missing in the data!


### Inspecting the target selection with `plot_target()`

To visually inspect the position of the designated target trees relative to the other trees in the neighbourhood, you can use the function `plot_target()`, which automatically displays the relevant information depending on the `target_source` setting for both `target_inv` datasets and the output of `compete_inv()` itself:

```{r plot-target, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot_target(targets4)
```
<img src="../man/figures/README-example3-1.png" alt="plot_trees" width="500">

The purpose of this function is to provide a fast tool for visual inspection rather than to create beautiful visual output. As all the data for the plot are contained in the `target_inv` object, more appealing (e.g., [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)-based) visualizations are left as an exercise to the user. 

### Computing competition indices with `compete_inv()`
`compete_inv()` is very flexible with its input, in essence directly accepting everything that can also be loaded with `read_inv()` and also passing additional settings for column specifications etc. on to this function, which is used to load the data internally. Also all options for `target_source` that can be set in `define_target()` can be directly specified in `compete_inv()`, and in most cases this function will likely be called directly unless there are reasons to perform the other steps explicitly, for instance, because the data structure and formatting differ between the inventory and target files or because an inspection of the target settings is desired _before_ computing the results.

If target trees have already been specified with `target_inv()`, the outcome can directly be passed to `compete_inv()`, which then ignores the target_source argument and all further arguments that are passed on to `read_inv()` and `define_target()`.

```{r comp1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
compete_inv(inv_source = targets4, radius = 10, method = "CI_Hegyi")
```

Otherwise, it is for example possible to calculate the Hegyi competition index from a data from a .csv source with non-standard column names and decimal and field separators (in this example, from a German file source) and then get reasonable target trees via `target_source = "buff_edge"`:

```{r comp2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
CI1 <- compete_inv(
  inv_source = "data/inventory5.csv",
  target_source = "buff_edge",
  radius = 10, 
  method = "CI_Hegyi",
  x = Koord_x, 
  y = Koord_y,
  id = Baumname,
  dbh = Durchmesser,
  sep = ";",
  dec = ","
  )
```

The output of this function can then again be inspected with `plot_target()` to make sure the selection of target trees make sense.

The function computes a series of inventory-based competition indices commonly used in the literature that can be specified via the `method` argument ([Hegyi 1974](https://search.worldcat.org/title/growth-models-for-tree-and-stand-simulation-proceedings-of-meetings-in-1973/oclc/1273734); Braathe, 1980; [Rouvinen & Kuuluvainen, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1139/x97-012); see also [Contreras et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.08.031)). These are either based on tree diameter at breast height ("CI_Hegyi", "CI_RK1", "CI_RK2") or on tree height ("CI_Braathe", "CI_RK3", "CI_RK4"). 
The mathematical definition of these indices is provided in the documentation of `compete_inv()`.

Note that all these indices are based on a distance-weighted sum of the relative size of all neighbor trees compared to the central tree or a transformation thereof. For that reason, all competition indices are extremely sensitive to the 

If `method = "all_methods"` (the standard setting), `compete_inv()` computes all indices that can be computed with the data available in the inventory.
