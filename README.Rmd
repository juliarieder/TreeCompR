R Package for calculating distance-dependent individual Tree Competition on Plot level
<!-- badges: end -->

This R package is designed for the quantitative analysis of individual tree competition within forest ecosystems. It accepts inputs such as LiDAR point clouds (as .txt or las/laz files) of forest plots or individual target trees, and inventory tables (including tree ID, X, Y, DBH, H). By leveraging a range of tools and algorithms, it allows to assess and measure tree-to-tree competition, providing valuable insights for forest ecology, inventory assessments, and forest management strategies. This package facilitates a systematic approach to understanding the interactions and resource competition among trees, enabling informed decision-making in forest management.

## Installation

You can install the development version of TreeCompR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("juliarieder/TreeCompR")
```

## Example

This is how to calculate the Hegyi Index 

```{r example}
library(TreeCompR)
## basic example code
```
